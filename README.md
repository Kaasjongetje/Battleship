# About

[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) is one of the projects that I made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship).

(Please ignore the ugly UI)

# To Do

1. Improve UI
2. Organize the file structure
3. Making a Location class instead of using an array of 2 items for a location
4. If the AI has found two ship parts in a row, either horizontally/vertically, it should only shoot horizontally/vertically
5. Using React to generate the UI

# Features

1. Drag / Drop system for the ships using [Interact JS](https://interactjs.io/)
2. Rotate system for the ships
3. Random ship placement button
4. AI that shoots the location with the [highest probability](http://datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html)

# Things I learned

1. Testing makes programming less stressful
2. Trying different solutions until finding one that works (Drag / Drop)
3. Understanding a library first before using it in a project
4. Doing research to find a suitable algorithm (AI)
5. Not writing too much code without testing it first (this prevents lots of bugs)
6. Organizing different parts of the code in different files
7. Creating extra functions to avoid repeating the same code
8. Thinking of the features that I want to add, their requirements and how I can organize them into classes and functions before writing any code 
9. Debugging errors that occured in the UI by finding the cause and then trying to fix it
10. Not thinking, in a way that could lead to stress, about bugs/things I don't know how to make whenever I'm not working on the project (less stressful)
